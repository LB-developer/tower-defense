# Tower Defense Game (In Development)

## Description

This project is a basic implementation of a Tower Defense game using React. The game is built on a 6x6 grid, where the player will strategically place towers to defend against incoming enemies. The project is currently in progress, and seeks to build off of the foundation in key mechanics such as grid rendering and pathfinding.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Grid Rendering**: A 6x6 grid is dynamically generated using React components, forming the basis for the game board.
- **Pathfinding Algorithm**: A custom algorithm ensures that enemies traverse the grid from start to end, following a unique path each time.
- **React Development**: The project leverages React for modular, scalable, and maintainable code, making it easy to extend with new features.

## In Progress

- **Tower Placement**: The next major feature will allow players to place towers on the grid to block or destroy enemies.
- **Enemy Waves**: Plans to implement multiple waves of enemies with increasing difficulty.
- **Scoring System**: A scoring system will track the playerâ€™s performance based on how effectively they defend the grid.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14 or later)
- **npm** (v6 or later)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   `git clone 'git@github.com:POR7ALa/tower-defense.git' cd tower-defense`

2. **Install dependencies**:

   `npm install`

3. **Run the development server**:

   `npm run dev`

## Future Development

This ongoing project is a Tower Defense game built with a focus on demonstrating comprehensive full-stack development skills. The current phase involves implementing features such as tower placement, enemy AI, scoring systems, and more. The goal is to create a fully functional Tower Defense game that showcases a robust understanding of React for the frontend, algorithmic problem-solving for game mechanics, and backend integration for data management and real-time updates.
